# Recovery Prompt for YouTube Summarizer Project

Hello Roo,

We are working on a project to build a "YouTube Summarizer" tool for a startup founder.

**Objective:** Create a simple web application that takes a YouTube URL and provides an AI-generated summary, key lessons, and their relevance to a startup founder.

**Project State:**
- The project directory `youtube-summarizer` has been created.
- The following documentation files have been created inside the directory:
    - `README.md`: Project overview.
    - `BLUEPRINT.md`: Technical architecture and plan.
    - `USER_GUIDE.md`: Instructions on how to use the tool.
    - `RECOVERY_PROMPT.md`: This file.

**Project Plan & To-Do List:**
You can find the full project plan in `BLUEPRINT.md`. Our current to-do list is:
- [x] Create project directory and documentation files

- [x] Integrate YouTube Transcript API
